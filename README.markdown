# Structured-streaming-cassandra

A Giter8 template for Structured Streaming with Cassandra. It is a simple application to show how we can stream data from Kafka to Cassandra.
There are a few types of built-in output sinks: file, Kafka, console, and memory sinks. However, if youâ€™d like to output the results of your streaming computation into a database you would need to use the foreach sink and implement the interface ForeachWriter.

Simply run: **sbt new knoldus/structured-streaming-cassandra.g8**


This project has following application:

- KafkaToCassandraApplication


***
### KafkaToCassandraApplication
This application provides a template for a **Structured Streaming**
application which **reads data from a Kafka topic** and **insert that
data into an Cassandra table**

**sbt "runMain com.knoldus.services.KafkaToCassandraApplication"**

***
